# opencv-car-speed
Application that tracks the speed of a car from a video

## Requirements

This project depends on OpenCV 4.5.4 and requires the following video files
(taken from [this](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/publications/book-supplements/A-Practical-Introduction-to-Computer-Vision-with-OpenCV/Code/) website). The files "CarSpeedTest1.mp4" and "CarSpeedTestEmptyFrame.jpg" should
be placed in a directory called "data" in the repo directory (or whichever
directory you run the application from)
